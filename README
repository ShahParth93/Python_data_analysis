Heart Disease UCI

We are given a dataset of 303 patients suffering or not from heart disease. We have many informations about the patients such as their age, sex, resting blood pressure, etc

The aim is to predict whether a patient has a heart disease or not, while applying Machine Learning to these features.

Since the output is categorical, i.e it takes only 2 values : 
0 (no heart disease) or 1 (with heart disease)
It is a Classification Problem

We saw that patients suffering from heart disease have higher heart rates and the more the slope of the peak is high, the more are chances to have a heart disease.

For the flask application, we must enter our values in the form and then we will get the predictions.
